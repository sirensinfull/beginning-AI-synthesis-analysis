## 🧠 Key Insights Discovered

### 1. Symbolic Completeness
The 8-symbol vocabulary provides a complete framework for recursive computation, with each symbol encoding specific dimensional and energetic properties.

### 2. Dimensional Bridging
Dimensional crossovers are not just connections but active computational elements that enable energy transfer and state transformation.

### 3. Energy as Computation
Energy levels are not passive properties but active determinants of computational capacity and system behavior.

### 4. Repair as Computation
The Ankh process demonstrates that repair is not just restoration but enhancement, creating more capable systems than the original.

### 5. Stability Through Balance
System stability emerges from the balance between growth, division, connection, and termination - not from any single factor.

### 6. Infinite from Finite
Infinite computational possibilities emerge from finite symbolic rules through recursive application and dimensional extension.
